Â INSTRUCTIONS:



1.Set up the environment

Ensure that all required Python modules are installed, and the Excel file containing your experimental data is ready.



2.Start the program

Run the thin film calculator script in your Python environment.



3.Load your data

When prompted, select the Excel file that contains your experimental values.



4.Enter parameters

Specify the minimum and maximum wavelengths for which you want to calculate the film thickness.



5.Execute the calculation

Run the program to process the data with the entered parameters.



6.View results

A graph will be generated. It shows your experimental data curve-fitted using the least error approximation method, helping you analyze the film thickness in the selected wavelength range.
